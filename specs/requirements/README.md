# Requirements Documentation

This section contains functional and non-functional requirements for all Merge Warden system components.

## Overview

The requirements documentation defines what the system must do (functional requirements) and how well it must do it (non-functional requirements). These requirements drive design decisions and provide acceptance criteria for implementation.

## Documents in This Section

### [Functional Requirements](./functional-requirements.md)

Core business functionality and feature specifications.

### [Platform Requirements](./platform-requirements.md)

GitHub, Azure, and CLI-specific requirements and constraints.

### [Performance Requirements](./performance-requirements.md)

Scalability, reliability, and performance specifications.

### [Compliance Requirements](./compliance-requirements.md)

Audit, governance, and regulatory requirements.

## Requirements Methodology

- **Testable**: All requirements include measurable acceptance criteria
- **Traceable**: Requirements linked to design decisions and implementation
- **Prioritized**: Requirements classified by importance and implementation priority
- **Validated**: Requirements reviewed and approved by stakeholders
