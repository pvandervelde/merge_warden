# Architecture Documentation

This section contains detailed architectural specifications for the Merge Warden system, covering system design, component interactions, and deployment patterns.

## Overview

The Merge Warden architecture follows a modular, platform-agnostic design that enables deployment across multiple cloud platforms while maintaining a consistent core validation engine. The system is built using Rust for performance, safety, and cross-platform compatibility.

## Architecture Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between core logic, platform integrations, and deployment targets
- **Platform Agnostic**: Core business logic independent of specific cloud providers or deployment methods
- **Testability**: Dependency injection and trait-based abstractions enable comprehensive testing
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for validation rules and platform integrations
- **Performance**: Stateless design with minimal resource overhead
- **Reliability**: Graceful error handling and fallback mechanisms

### [System Overview](./system-overview.md)

High-level system architecture, data flow, and component interactions. Includes system context diagrams and integration patterns.

### [Core Components](./core-components.md)

Detailed design of the core library, validation engine, and business logic components. Covers the foundational abstractions and patterns.

### [Platform Integrations](./platform-integrations.md)

### [Deployment Architectures](./deployment-architectures.md)

Specific deployment target architectures including Azure Functions, CLI interface, and patterns for future platform support.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Trait-Based Abstractions

All external integrations use trait-based abstractions to enable testing, extensibility, and platform independence.

### Stateless Design

Components maintain no persistent state, enabling horizontal scaling and simplified deployment.

### Configuration-Driven Behavior

Runtime behavior controlled through configuration rather than code changes, supporting diverse repository requirements.

### Error-First Design

Comprehensive error types and handling patterns ensure graceful failure and actionable user feedback.
