# Monitoring and Observability

Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and observability strategy for Merge Warden across all deployment targets and operational scenarios.

## Overview

This document defines the monitoring architecture, metrics collection, alerting strategies, and observability practices for maintaining operational excellence in Merge Warden deployments. It covers application performance monitoring, business metrics, security monitoring, and operational dashboards.

## Monitoring Architecture

### Core Components

**Azure Monitor (Primary Platform)**

- Application Insights for application telemetry

```

### Telemetry Collection

**Application Telemetry**

```rust
// Custom telemetry traits
pub trait TelemetryProvider {
    fn track_event(&self, name: &str, properties: HashMap<String, String>);
    fn track_metric(&self, name: &str, value: f64, properties: Option<HashMap<String, String>>);
    fn track_dependency(&self, name: &str, duration: Duration, success: bool);
    fn track_exception(&self, exception: &dyn Error);
}

// Business events
pub enum BusinessEvent {
    PullRequestProcessed {
        repository: String,
        pr_number: u64,
        validation_result: ValidationResult,
        processing_time_ms: u64,
    },
    PolicyViolation {
        repository: String,
        policy_type: String,
        severity: String,
    },
    BypassActivated {
        repository: String,
        user: String,
        bypass_type: String,
    },
}
```

**Infrastructure Metrics**

- Function execution metrics (invocations, duration, errors)
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, storage)
- Network metrics (latency, throughput, errors)
- Cost and billing metrics

## Application Performance Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators

**Response Time Metrics**

- P50, P95, P99 response times for webhook processing
- GitHub API call latencies
- Configuration loading times
- Database query performance (if applicable)

**Throughput Metrics**

- Requests per second
- Pull requests processed per hour
- Webhook delivery success rates
- API rate limit utilization

**Error Metrics**

- Error rates by error type
- Failed webhook deliveries
- Authentication failures
- Configuration validation errors

### Performance Dashboards

**Real-time Operations Dashboard**

```kusto
// Example KQL queries for dashboards
requests
| where timestamp > ago(1h)
| summarize
    RequestCount = count(),
    AvgDuration = avg(duration),
    P95Duration = percentile(duration, 95)
    by bin(timestamp, 5m)
| render timechart

exceptions
| where timestamp > ago(24h)
| summarize ErrorCount = count() by type, bin(timestamp, 1h)
| render barchart
```

**Business Metrics Dashboard**

- Repository adoption rates
- Policy compliance trends
- Feature usage statistics
- User behavior patterns

## Logging Strategy

### Log Levels and Categories

**Structured Logging**

```rust
use tracing::{info, warn, error, debug, trace};
use serde_json::json;

// Example structured logging
info!(
    repository = %repo_name,
    pr_number = pr.number,
    validation_result = ?result,
    processing_time_ms = elapsed.as_millis(),
    "Pull request validation completed"
);

warn!(
    repository = %repo_name,
    user = %user_login,
    bypass_type = %bypass.rule_type,
    "Bypass rule activated"
);

error!(
    error = %err,
    repository = %repo_name,
    operation = "webhook_processing",
    "Failed to process webhook"
);
```

**Log Categories**

- **Application**: Business logic execution
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, bypasses
- **Performance**: Timing, resource usage
- **Integration**: External API calls
- **Configuration**: Configuration loading and validation

### Log Retention and Analysis

**Retention Policies**

- **Hot tier**: 30 days for active querying
- **Cool tier**: 90 days for compliance
- **Archive tier**: 1 year for audit requirements

**Log Analysis Queries**

```kusto
// Security monitoring
traces
| where customDimensions.category == "security"
| where customDimensions.event_type == "bypass_activated"
| summarize count() by tostring(customDimensions.repository), bin(timestamp, 1d)
| order by timestamp desc

// Performance analysis
requests
| where operation_Name == "process_webhook"
| where duration > 5000  // Slow requests > 5 seconds
| project timestamp, customDimensions.repository, duration, resultCode
| order by timestamp desc
```

## Alerting and Incident Response

### Alert Categories

**Critical Alerts (P0)**

- Service unavailability (error rate > 10%)
- Authentication system failures
- Data corruption or loss
- Security breaches

**High Priority Alerts (P1)**

- Performance degradation (P95 > 10 seconds)
- High error rates (> 5%)
- Configuration failures
- API rate limit exceeded

**Medium Priority Alerts (P2)**

- Slow performance trends
- Unusual usage patterns
- Resource utilization warnings
- Configuration validation failures

**Low Priority Alerts (P3)**

- Information alerts
- Capacity planning notifications
- Maintenance reminders

### Alert Configuration

**Azure Monitor Alert Rules**

```json
{
  "alertRuleName": "High Error Rate",
  "description": "Alert when error rate exceeds 5% over 10 minutes",
  "severity": 1,
  "criteria": {
    "metricName": "requests/failed",
    "operator": "GreaterThan",
    "threshold": 5,
    "timeAggregation": "Percentage",
    "windowSize": "PT10M"
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "actionGroupId": "/subscriptions/.../actionGroups/critical-alerts"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Incident Response Procedures

**Response Matrix**

| Severity | Response Time | Escalation | Communication |
|----------|--------------|------------|---------------|
| P0 | 15 minutes | Immediate | All stakeholders |
| P1 | 1 hour | 2 hours | Development team |
| P2 | 4 hours | 8 hours | Operations team |
| P3 | 24 hours | 72 hours | Documentation |

**Incident Workflow**

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring triggers alert
2. **Triage**: On-call engineer assesses severity
3. **Response**: Appropriate response team engaged
4. **Mitigation**: Immediate actions to restore service
5. **Resolution**: Root cause analysis and permanent fix
