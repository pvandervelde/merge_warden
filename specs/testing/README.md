## Testing Principles

- **Test Pyramid**: Comprehensive unit tests, focused integration tests, minimal E2E tests
- **Fast Feedback**: Quick test execution for rapid development cycles
- **Reliable Tests**: Consistent, predictable test results
- **Clear Failures**: Actionable failure messages and debugging information
