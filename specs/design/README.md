# Design Documentation

This section contains detailed design specifications for the Merge Warden system, covering design decisions, patterns, and system behavior specifications.

## Overview

The design documentation focuses on the implementation patterns, configuration systems, and behavioral specifications that guide the development of Merge Warden. These documents bridge the gap between high-level architecture and concrete implementation.

## Design Philosophy

### Configuration-Driven Behavior

The system behavior is controlled through configuration rather than code changes, enabling flexible deployment across diverse repository requirements.

### Extensible Rule Engine

Validation rules are designed as pluggable components that can be easily added, modified, or disabled without affecting the core system.

### User Experience First

All design decisions prioritize clear, actionable feedback to developers with minimal friction in the development workflow.

### Audit and Compliance

Every action and decision is logged and traceable, supporting enterprise governance and compliance requirements.

## Documents in This Section

### [Configuration System](./configuration-system.md)

Comprehensive design of the configuration schema, validation, and lifecycle management. Covers repository-specific configuration, centralized settings, and runtime updates.

### [Validation Engine](./validation-engine.md)

Design of the PR validation rules and extensibility framework. Details the rule engine architecture, built-in validation rules, and patterns for custom rule development.

### [Labeling System](./labeling-system.md)

Automatic labeling and categorization system design. Covers size-based labeling, change type classification, and custom labeling strategies.

### [Bypass Mechanisms](./bypass-mechanisms.md)

Design of bypass logging, audit trails, and governance features. Details the bypass system architecture, permission models, and compliance tracking.

## Key Design Patterns

### Event-Driven Architecture

The system responds to GitHub events (pull request creation, updates, reviews) using an event-driven pattern that enables loose coupling and extensibility.

### Strategy Pattern for Rules

Validation rules implement a common interface while providing different validation strategies, enabling easy addition and modification of validation logic.

### Template-Based Communication

User-facing messages use templates that can be customized per repository while maintaining consistent structure and branding.

### Hierarchical Configuration

Configuration is loaded from multiple sources in a defined hierarchy, allowing for global defaults, organizational policies, and repository-specific customizations.

## Design Decisions Log

### Configuration Format Choice

**Decision**: Use TOML for configuration files
**Rationale**: Human-readable, widely adopted in Rust ecosystem, good balance of features and simplicity
**Alternatives Considered**: YAML (too complex), JSON (not human-friendly)

### Rule Engine Architecture

**Decision**: Trait-based rule system with dynamic dispatch
**Rationale**: Enables plugin-style rule development while maintaining type safety
**Alternatives Considered**: Macro-based rules (too complex), hardcoded rules (not extensible)

### Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Comprehensive error types with context preservation
**Rationale**: Enables good user feedback and debugging while maintaining type safety
**Alternatives Considered**: Simple string errors (poor UX), anyhow everywhere (loses context)

### Caching Strategy

**Decision**: Multi-level caching with TTL-based invalidation
**Rationale**: Balances performance with data freshness requirements
**Alternatives Considered**: No caching (poor performance), eternal caching (stale data)

## Implementation Guidelines

### Adding New Validation Rules

1. **Define Rule Interface**: Implement the `ValidationRule` trait
2. **Add Configuration Schema**: Update configuration types to include rule settings
3. **Implement Validation Logic**: Create the core validation functionality
4. **Add Tests**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
5. **Update Documentation**: Add rule documentation and examples

### Extending Configuration Options

1. **Schema Versioning**: Increment schema version for breaking changes
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain support for previous schema versions
3. **Validation**: Add configuration validation logic
4. **Migration Path**: Provide clear migration instructions
5. **Default Values**: Ensure sensible defaults for new options

### Adding New Platforms

1. **Platform Abstraction**: Implement platform provider traits
2. **Authentication**: Add platform-specific authentication methods
3. **API Integration**: Implement platform API client
4. **Error Mapping**: Map platform errors to common error types
5. **Testing**: Add integration tests with platform APIs
