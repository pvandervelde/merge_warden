# Security Documentation

This section contains security architecture, threat model, and protection mechanisms for the Merge Warden system.

## Overview

The security documentation defines the security architecture, threat landscape, and protection mechanisms required to operate Merge Warden safely in production environments. This includes authentication, authorization, data protection, and threat mitigation strategies.

## Documents in This Section

### [Authentication](./authentication.md)

GitHub App authentication and token management systems.

### [Authorization](./authorization.md)

Permission models and access control mechanisms.

### [Data Protection](./data-protection.md)

Secrets management and data handling procedures.

### [Threat Model](./threat-model.md)

Security threats analysis and mitigation strategies.

## Security Principles

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary access for all operations
- **Zero Trust**: Verify all access requests regardless of source
- **Security by Design**: Security considerations integrated throughout development
