# Merge Warden Specification

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** July 20, 2025
**Status:** Living Document

## Overview

Merge Warden is a comprehensive pull request validation and governance system designed to enforce repository policies, improve code quality, and streamline development workflows. It operates as a GitHub App that automatically validates pull requests against configurable rules and provides detailed feedback to developers.

### Purpose and Goals

**Primary Goal**: Ensure all pull requests provide sufficient information for future developers to understand the changes, their rationale, and their impact on the system.

**Key Objectives**:

- **Quality Assurance**: Enforce conventional commit standards and require work item references
- **Process Automation**: Automate labeling, size assessment, and milestone synchronization
- **Governance**: Provide audit trails and bypass mechanisms for exceptional cases
- **Developer Experience**: Offer clear, actionable feedback and multiple deployment options
- **Maintainability**: Create a robust, testable, and extensible system architecture

### System Capabilities

- **Multi-Platform Deployment**: Azure Functions, CLI, and future cloud platforms
- **Configurable Validation Rules**: Title format, work item references, PR size limits
- **Intelligent Labeling**: Automatic size labeling and change type classification
- **Audit and Compliance**: Comprehensive logging and bypass tracking
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end validation with real GitHub repositories
- **Centralized Configuration**: Azure App Configuration integration for dynamic updates
