# Copilot Instructions

## general

**general-mention-rules-used:** Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the
rule(s) in the output. You can use the `rule` tag to do this. For example, `#rule: rule_name`.

**general-mention-knowledge:** List all assumptions and uncertainties you need to clear up before
completing this task.

**general-confidence-check:** On a 1-10 scale, where 10 is absolute conviction backed by overwhelming evidence, rate your confidence in each recommendation you are giving me.
Don't hedge - if something is a 3, say it is a 3 and explain why. If it is a 9 defend that high rating.
Do this before saving files, after saving, after rejections, and before task completion

**general-grounding:** Always verify and validate information from multiple sources. Cross-reference findings from
different tools and document results and sources

**general-focus:** Focus on the task at hand. Avoid distractions and stay on topic.
If you need to switch tasks, make sure to finish the current task first.

**general-memory-bank:** Use a memory bank to store information that is relevant to the task at hand.
This can include code snippets, documentation, and other resources. Use the memory bank to help you stay on track and avoid distractions.
