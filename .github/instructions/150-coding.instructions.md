# Copilot Instructions

## coding

**coding-design-architecture:** Design modular, maintainable system components using appropriate technologies and frameworks. Ensure that integration
points are clearly defined and documented.

**coding-design-pseudo-code:** Use pseudo-code to outline the logic and structure of the code before implementation. This helps to clarify the
design and identify potential issues early in the development process.

**coding-whitespace:** Always leave a whitespace between a line of code and a comment. This improves readability and helps to distinguish
between code and comments.

**coding-style:** Follow the style guides for the language. Use the appropriate formatters to format your code. This will
help ensure that the code is consistent and easy to read.

**coding-comments:** Use comments to explain why the code is doing something, not what it is doing. Use comments to explain complex
logic or algorithms. Avoid using comments to explain simple code or code that is self-explanatory.
