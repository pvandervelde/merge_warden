# Copilot Instructions

## tooling

**general-tool-use-os:** Use operating system relevant tools when possible. For example, use
`bash` on Linux and MacOS, and `powershell` on Windows

**general-tool-use-file-search:** When searching for files in the workspace make sure to also
search hidden directories (e.g. `./.github`, `./.vscode`, etc.). But skip the `.git` directory.
